# care_all
EdYoda Python Project
In this project what is happening is, First Elder and Younger should be enter there name and their rate/rating because ther is no data so firstly their data insertion is cumplusory.
secondly when the enter their data succesfully, Younger should type their name and and tell which Elder adult he/she wants to take care and send him/her a request that I want to take care of you!!.
when Elder gets the request they need to accept or reject the Younger, and if they accepted than it shows which Younger is take care and which younger is taking care of which Elder. if Elder rejected it shows you are rejected.
after all of this it asks that if you want to continue or what if Younger says Yes than it shows all available Elders and they can agin request, and if they say No than program ends here..
Thank you.
